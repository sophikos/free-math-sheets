  Missing from Common Core

  High Priority Additions (commonly used, straightforward to implement):

  1. Factors & Multiples (4th grade - 4.OA.4)
  - Find all factors of a number
  - GCF (Greatest Common Factor)
  - LCM (Least Common Multiple)
  - Prime vs Composite identification

  2. Order of Operations (5th grade - 5.OA.1)
  - Evaluate expressions: 3 + 4 × 2
  - Parentheses: (3 + 4) × 2
  - PEMDAS practice

  3. Measurement Conversions (4th/5th - 4.MD.1, 5.MD.1)
  - Customary: inches↔feet↔yards, ounces↔pounds, cups↔gallons
  - Metric: mm↔cm↔m↔km, g↔kg, mL↔L
  - Time: seconds↔minutes↔hours

  4. Volume (5th grade - 5.MD.3-5)
  - Volume of rectangular prisms (l × w × h)
  - Unit cube counting

  Medium Priority:

  5. Geometry Classification (4th/5th - 4.G.1-2, 5.G.3-4)
  - Classify angles (acute/right/obtuse)
  - Classify triangles
  - Classify quadrilaterals

  6. Percentages (bridge to 6th grade)
  - Fraction → percentage
  - Decimal → percentage
  - Find X% of a number

  7. Coordinate Graphing (5th - 5.G.1-2)
  - Identify coordinates from a grid
  - Plot ordered pairs

  My Recommendation

  Start with Factors & Multiples and Order of Operations - these are:
  - Very common on math worksheets
  - Easy to generate and display in the current format
  - Core skills that students practice repeatedly

  Would you like me to implement any of these?





  1. Replace placeholder URLs - Change https://worksheets.numerikos.com/ to your actual URL
  2. Create og-image.png - Recommended 1200x630px image for social sharing previews
  3. Create favicon files:
    - favicon.ico (multi-size)
    - favicon-32x32.png
    - favicon-16x16.png
    - apple-touch-icon.png (180x180)
  4. Optional: Add robots.txt and sitemap.xml if this will be a standalone site


  robots.txt
  - Allows all crawlers to index the site
  - Points to sitemap location

  sitemap.xml
  - Single page sitemap (since it's a single-page app)
  - Set to monthly changefreq with priority 1.0

  Remember to update https://worksheets.numerikos.com/ to your actual production URL in:
  - index.html (canonical, og:url, og:image, twitter:image, JSON-LD)
  - robots.txt (Sitemap reference)
  - sitemap.xml (loc)

  Gaps & Suggestions

  High Priority (Common Worksheet Requests)

  1. Lower grades (K-3) - Huge market for basic worksheets
    - Counting, number recognition, basic facts
    - Single-digit addition/subtraction
    - Skip counting, number patterns
  2. Geometry - Only volume exists currently
    - Area (rectangles, triangles, parallelograms)
    - Perimeter
    - Angles (measuring, classifying)
  3. Word Problems - Very popular for worksheets
    - Could be added as an option for existing operations

  Medium Priority

  4. 6th Grade - Natural extension
    - Ratios and proportions
    - Percentages
    - Basic algebra (one-step equations)
    - Coordinate graphing
  5. Data & Statistics
    - Mean, median, mode, range
    - Reading charts/graphs

  Lower Priority (Nice to Have)

  6. Number lines - Visual placement problems
  7. Patterns & sequences - Find the rule, continue the pattern
  8. Probability basics - Simple likelihood

  My Recommendation

  For a standalone worksheet generator, I'd prioritize:

  1. Add K-3 grades - Expands audience significantly
  2. Add Geometry (area/perimeter) - High-demand worksheet topic
  3. Add Word Problems option - Differentiator from basic generators

  Would you like me to implement any of these additions?
